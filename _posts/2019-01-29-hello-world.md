title: "Welcome to My First Blog Post!"
---

**Hello world**, this is my first  blog post ðŸ¤™.

I planned to create personal blog post a long time ago. However only today I got some motivation 
and time to do it. I want to write about useful information and interesting things. I hope
it will be great journey and will be fun).

First of all I want to thank [Github personal website](https://github.com/github/personal-website) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) team for building such a great tool for making it possible. I have created this blog post
randomly ðŸ˜‚. I did not plan to create blog post in near feature. I was browsing my daily news feeds and read about 
[Google opens .dev domain for everyone](https://developers.googleblog.com/2019/02/dev-for-all.html) then noticed that GitHub also got `.dev` domain [https://github.dev](https://github.dev).

Then you guessed, I clicked on "Create your website" button. These days advertisements are influencing me ðŸ™ˆ. After that I have installed [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) tool which helps to generate static web pages.
And as you see here is my personal website dreaming for 2 years but spending 2 hours.

I am planning to register `.dev` domain for this site. Maybe it will take long time to make it or maybe I will do it randomly again.

I want to recommend to create personal website even if you do not write blog posts. It just proves that you have one)
